The Chat App

The goal was to build a clean,working interface for a chat application using react native without using on heavy UI libraries.I focused on making the navigation feel smooth and keeping the code organized and clean.

Flow of App
The Login (Welcome Screen): When you first open the app, it asks  your name. I used AsyncStorage to save your name, so the app remembers you next time.
Home Screen: Once you're in, you see a list of recent chats. These are just static placeholder data for now, but they show how the list looks.
Chat Interface: If you click on a chat,it takes you to a message screen.It looks like a real conversation with bubbles for sent and received messages.
Nearby Users: I added a tab to see other users.
Settings: This is where you can see save option for a user.
